            <h1 style="float: left; padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 15px; position: absolute;">A Brief Introduction to HotBeans</h1>
            <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 90px; color: var(--text); font-size: 20px; position: absolute;">HotBeans is a website development 
            company based in London in the United Kingdom, we take commissions from customers and if we agree on a contract we design and build a full website from the ground up.
            So far HotBeans has shown great success in the time we have been operational with the almost one hundred website contracts we have been entrusted to build for our 
            customers demonstrating that we are a capable company and show great promise for our future in website development. HotBeans is a fairly small scale company run by 
            a close knit team of website developers and designers creating a very creative atmosphere amongst the workplace resulting in end products that truly show this level 
            of creativity and team work.</h2>
            
            <h1 style="float: left; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 220px; position: absolute;">Why Buy From HotBeans</h1>
            <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 300px; color: var(--text); font-size: 20px;">HotBeans is a website development company available to all,
            we have done and can do website builds from the smallest scale all the way up to the largest scale, if you give us the time and required information we can make it happen. 
            Our custom tailored sites have been viewed by hundreds of thousnds of people this year providing popular functionality and style to all who come across them. We also pride
            ourselves on having good contact with the customer during the build process so we send regular build updates and progress reviews to you to keep you in the loop of how your
            projects going, where abouts we are at and what we have done last which almost all of our previous customers appropriated and found very comforting that they knew we were
            working hard.</h2>

            <h1 style="float: left; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 50px; position: absolute;">How Much is a Contract</h1>
            <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 130px; color: var(--text); font-size: 20px;">As we said we take contracts of all sizes from all customers so it 
            really depends on alot of factors such as: amount of web pages, amount of code, how complex the idea sounds, how much media has to be handled, how much media has to be created,
            how long it takes and a couple other factors that can be discussed if you come to us with a proposal. The process of purchasing a build contract goes as follows: a customer 
            comes into contact with us about an idea, we discuss the idea with them to understand their idea fully, if they are fully serious about purchasing then the entire HotBeans team
            will then discuss the idea briefly and come up with a rough figure for what it will cost and time frame and then the customer can decide if they would like to go through with it,
            if they do then we start prototyping things and making basic designs looking into how their designs will work which will allow us to get a final accurate cost which we can then 
            send to the client, after payment has been recieved we can then start working full speed ahead on their project.</h2>
